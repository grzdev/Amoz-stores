# amoz_stores

This is a simple e-commerce app that sells hats. It's my first project with flutter. The UI of this app is poorly built because I had to focus on the funtionality while trying to meet up with HNG's deadline. 

For the functionalities, I got inspiration from the several e-commerce projects I've built with other tools. For some reason, the images for each product loads locally, but displays "Could not load image" error when hosted on appetize. Here are some screenshots of the app.
